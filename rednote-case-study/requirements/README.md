# RedNote System Requirements

## Overview

This section contains comprehensive system requirements for the RedNote (Xiaohongshu) social media platform. The requirements are organized into functional requirements, non-functional requirements, scale estimates, and prioritization analysis.

## Contents

### 1. [Functional Requirements](content/functional-requirements.md)
Detailed functional requirements organized by major feature areas:
- User Management (registration, authentication, profiles, social relationships)
- Content Creation and Management (posting, interactions, media)
- Content Discovery and Feed (personalized feed, explore, search)
- Recommendations and Personalization
- Notifications
- E-commerce Integration
- Analytics and Insights

**Key Highlights:**
- 7 major functional areas
- Priority levels (P0-P3) for each requirement
- MVP scope clearly defined
- Dependencies mapped between requirements

### 2. [Non-Functional Requirements](content/non-functional-requirements.md)
Quality attributes and system constraints:
- Performance (response time, throughput, latency)
- Scalability (user scale, content scale, horizontal scaling)
- Availability and Reliability (uptime, fault tolerance, disaster recovery)
- Security (authentication, data protection, application security)
- Maintainability and Operability
- Usability and Accessibility
- Cost and Resource Efficiency
- Compliance and Legal

**Key Targets:**
- 99.9% availability
- < 2s feed load time
- 50M DAU (current), 100M DAU (3 years)
- < $0.10 per DAU cost

### 3. [Scale Estimates](content/scale-estimates.md)
Detailed capacity planning and scale calculations:
- User and traffic estimates (50M DAU, 10M posts/day)
- Requests per second calculations (277K peak RPS)
- Storage requirements (130PB/year growth)
- Bandwidth estimates (31PB/day CDN traffic)
- Database capacity planning (100 shards, 400 instances)
- Cache layer sizing (600GB total)
- Compute resource estimates (920 instances)
- Cost projections ($3.6M/month, $0.073 per DAU)
- Bottleneck analysis and mitigation strategies

**Key Metrics:**
- 50M DAU generating 10M posts/day
- 277K peak RPS (mostly reads)
- 130PB/year storage growth
- $0.073 per DAU infrastructure cost

### 4. [Requirement Prioritization and Trade-offs](content/requirement-prioritization.md)
Strategic analysis of priorities and architectural decisions:
- Prioritization framework (P0-P3 with criteria)
- Functional requirements prioritization (MVP vs. post-MVP)
- Non-functional requirements prioritization
- Major trade-off analyses:
  - Consistency vs. Availability (CAP theorem)
  - Performance vs. Cost
  - Feature Richness vs. Simplicity
  - Build vs. Buy vs. Open Source
  - Monolith vs. Microservices
  - Real-time vs. Batch Processing
- Risk analysis and mitigation
- Success metrics and review process

**Key Decisions:**
- Favor availability (AP) with eventual consistency
- Balanced approach: performance within cost constraints
- Focused MVP: 10-12 features, 3-4 month timeline
- Buy infrastructure, build differentiators
- Start with modular monolith, evolve to microservices

## How to Use This Section

### For System Designers
1. Start with **Functional Requirements** to understand what the system must do
2. Review **Non-Functional Requirements** to understand quality constraints
3. Study **Scale Estimates** to understand capacity needs
4. Read **Prioritization** to understand trade-offs and decisions

### For Developers
1. Focus on **Functional Requirements** for feature implementation
2. Reference **Scale Estimates** for performance targets
3. Consult **Prioritization** for MVP scope and phasing

### For Product Managers
1. Review **Functional Requirements** for feature roadmap
2. Study **Prioritization** for MVP definition and trade-offs
3. Reference **Scale Estimates** for capacity planning

### For Educators
1. Use this as a complete example of requirements gathering
2. Demonstrate how to break down a complex system
3. Show real-world trade-offs and decision-making
4. Illustrate capacity planning and cost estimation

## Requirements Traceability

All requirements in this section are referenced in:
- **Design Document** (03-architecture): Shows how requirements are addressed
- **Component Designs** (04-components): Maps requirements to specific components
- **Implementation Tasks**: Links tasks back to requirements

## Next Steps

After understanding the requirements:
1. Proceed to **03-architecture** for high-level system design
2. Review **04-components** for detailed component designs
3. Study **business-patterns** for common design patterns used

## Key Takeaways

1. **Requirements Drive Design:** All architectural decisions trace back to requirements
2. **Trade-offs Are Inevitable:** No perfect solution, must balance competing concerns
3. **Scale Matters:** Requirements at 50M DAU are very different from 1M DAU
4. **Prioritization Is Critical:** Cannot build everything at once, must focus on MVP
5. **Non-Functional Requirements Are Requirements:** Performance, scalability, and cost are as important as features
6. **Measure Everything:** Define success metrics and monitor continuously
