## Trade-offs and Prioritization

### Consistency vs. Availability
- **Decision:** Favor availability over strong consistency
- **Rationale:** Social media can tolerate eventual consistency for better user experience
- **Implementation:** Use eventual consistency for feeds, likes, follower counts

### Performance vs. Cost
- **Decision:** Optimize for performance within cost constraints
- **Rationale:** User experience drives engagement and retention
- **Implementation:** Aggressive caching, CDN usage, but monitor costs closely

### Security vs. Usability
- **Decision:** Balance security with user convenience
- **Rationale:** Too much friction reduces user adoption
- **Implementation:** Optional MFA, risk-based authentication, seamless social login

### Feature Richness vs. Simplicity
- **Decision:** Start simple, add complexity based on user feedback
- **Rationale:** Faster time to market, easier to maintain
- **Implementation:** MVP with core features, iterative enhancement
