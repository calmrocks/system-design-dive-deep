## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of requirement prioritization for the RedNote platform, examining trade-offs between competing concerns and providing decision frameworks for making architectural choices.

## 1. Prioritization Framework

### 1.1 Priority Levels

**P0 - Critical (Must Have for MVP)**
- Core functionality without which the platform cannot operate
- Directly impacts user ability to create and consume content
- Required for basic social media experience
- Timeline: Launch (Month 0)

**P1 - High Priority (Essential for Success)**
- Significantly enhances user experience and engagement
- Differentiates platform from competitors
- Drives user retention and growth
- Timeline: 1-3 months post-launch

**P2 - Medium Priority (Important but Not Urgent)**
- Improves user experience incrementally
- Supports business goals but not critical
- Can be delayed without major impact
- Timeline: 3-6 months post-launch

**P3 - Low Priority (Nice to Have)**
- Future enhancements and optimizations
- Experimental features
- Can be indefinitely postponed

## 4. Major Trade-off Analyses

### 4.1 Consistency vs. Availability (CAP Theorem)

**Context:** Distributed system must choose between consistency and availability during network partitions.

**Options:**

**Option A: Strong Consistency (CP)**
- **Pros:**
  - Data always accurate and up-to-date
  - Simpler reasoning about system state
  - No conflicting updates
- **Cons:**
  - Reduced availability during failures
  - Higher latency for writes
  - More complex coordination
- **Use Cases:** Financial transactions, inventory management

**Option B: High Availability (AP)**

- Clear module boundaries enable future extraction
- Extract services as scale demands (user service, media service, recommendation service)

**Migration Path:**
1. **Phase 1 (MVP):** Modular monolith with clear boundaries
2. **Phase 2 (Scale):** Extract high-load services (media, recommendations)
3. **Phase 3 (Maturity):** Full microservices for independent scaling

### 4.6 Real-time vs. Batch Processing

**Context:** Different data processing approaches have different trade-offs.

**Analysis by Use Case:**

| Use Case | Real-time | Batch | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Feed Generation | ⚠️ | ✅ | Hybrid | Pre-compute + real-time updates |
| Recommendations | ❌ | ✅ | Batch | Complex ML, can tolerate delay |
| Notifications | ✅ | ❌ | Real-time | User expectation |
| Analytics | ❌ | ✅ | Batch | Large data volumes |
| Search Indexing | ⚠️ | ✅ | Near real-time | Balance freshness and cost |
| Like Counts | ⚠️ | ✅ | Eventual | Aggregate periodically |

**Decision: Hybrid Approach**

**Rationale:**
- Use real-time for user-facing interactions (notifications, likes)

## Conclusion

The prioritization framework balances user needs, business goals, and technical constraints. The MVP focuses on core social media functionality with a path to scale and monetization. Key trade-offs favor availability over consistency, performance within cost constraints, and a focused feature set over feature richness. The modular monolith architecture enables rapid development while maintaining a path to microservices as scale demands.
